# architectural_style_classification
Quick model perform architectural style classification. Used as a baseline to perform conterfactual driven data augmentation after.

# Usage
Provide path to the data inside config.py
It is expected to follow the branching present originally in the dataset, otherwise perform adequat change to config.py and dataloader.py

# Folder organisation
|Root
    |Data
        |Dataset-IGRB1092_14cls
            |original disposition of the dataset
            |csv for training are created here (provided in this project, feel free to move them at the right place)
        |pascalPartDataset
            |original disposition of the dataset
            |txt for training are created here (provided in this project, feel free to move them at the right place)
    |MonuMAI-AutomaticStyleClassification (my branch)
    |pytorch-retinanet (my branch)
    |architectural_style_classification (this project)

If the folder organisation if different, change the various import path + the config.py file.

# How to run

First run 'python build-csv.py'
Then 'train.py' default parameter should work
